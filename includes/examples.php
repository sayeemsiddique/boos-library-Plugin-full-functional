Falsely implicated in a hijacking, he\'s offered a chance to clear himself by helping the CIA snare their real prey, Dugan\'s best friend, London ship owner Alex Kairouz. Reluctantly, Dugan agrees to go undercover in Alex\'s company, despite doubts about his friend\'s guilt. Once undercover, Dugan\'s steadfast refusal to accept Alex\'s guilt puts him at odds not only with his CIA superiors, but also with a beautiful British agent with whom he\'s romantically involved. When a tanker is found adrift near Singapore with a dead crew, and another explodes in Panama as Alex lies near death after a suspicious suicide attempt, Dugan is framed for the attacks. Out of options, and convinced the attacks are prelude to an even more devastating assault, Dugan eludes capture to follow his last lead to Russia, only to be shanghaied as an \'advisor\' to a Russian Spetsnaz unit on a suicide mission. <em>Deadly Straits</em> is a non-stop thrill ride, from London streets, to the dry docks of Singapore, to the decks of the tankers that feed the world\'s thirst for oil, with stops along the way in Panama, Langley, Virginia, and Teheran. Richly spiced with detail from the author\'s 30 years sailing, building, and repairing ships worldwide, it is, in the words of one reviewer, "fast-paced, multilayered and gripping."',

On the contrary, we can determine truth through our five senses, and that truth reliably points to a deeper and unseen reality.\n\nMark walks readers through twenty arrows that point towards Christian beliefs: from the intricate design of the universe to archaeological proofs, from the consistent testimony of changed lives to the reliability of the ancient documents of the Bible. After studying these arrows, you'll put this book down with a renewed confidence in what you believe and why it matters for eternity.",
